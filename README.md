# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I chose this project because I like hockey and particularly the Dallas Stars who play in the National Hockey League. Also I chose to do this project because I just graduated Full-Stack/ Web Development @ Kingsland University and I wanted to do antoher project. This one just happens to involve my favorite hockey team. 

# About the Project

This is a fully functional Blog Page, with a **Home** page, **History** page, **Sign-up** page, **Login**, **Logout**, & **New Blog** page also.

# Install Libraries

Install the concurrent library with *npm install concurrent*

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

I did this webpage because I needed some more practice with React.js and also(of course) I love the Dallas Stars(NHL) hockey team! This webpage is functioning correctly. Thank you for visiting my repositiory!
