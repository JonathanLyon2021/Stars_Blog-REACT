# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I chose this project because I like hockey and particularly the Dallas Stars who play in the National Hockey League. Also I chose to do this project because I just graduated Full-Stack/ Web Development @ Kingsland University and I wanted to do antoher project. This one just happens to involve my favorite hockey team. 

# About the Project

This is a fully functional Blog Page, with a **Home** page, **History** page, **Sign-up** page, **Login**, **Logout**, & **New Blog** page also.

# Install Libraries

Install the concurrent library with *npm install concurrent*

# What I Learned

This repository was based on building a Blog website where you can create(post) blogs, read(get) blogs, append(put, patch) blogs. I learned better ways of inserting images into the Blog, also I learned better CSS practices.
I did this webpage because I needed some more practice with React.js and also(of course) I love the Dallas Stars(NHL) hockey team! Thank you for visiting my repositiory!
